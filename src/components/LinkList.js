// When using Apollo, you've got two ways of sending queries to the servier.

/* 1) Use the query method on the ApolloClient directly. This is a more imperative way of fetching data
and will allow you to process the response as a promise i.e. like Axios.

client.query({
  query: gql`
    query AllLinks {
      allLinks {
        id
      }
    }
  `
}).then(response => console.log(response.data.allLinks)) */

/* 2) A more idiomatic way when using React, however, is to use Apollo's HOC graphql to wrap your
React component with a query. 

With this approach all you need to do when it comes to fetching data is write the GraphQL query and graphql
will fetch the data for you under the hood and then make it available in your component's props.

In general, the process for you to add some data fetching logic will be very similar every time:

i) write the query as a JS constant using the gql parser function
ii) use the graphql container to wrap your component with the query
iii) access the query results in the component's props */

// stores the query
// gql function is used to parse the plain GraphQL code
// define plain GraphQL query
const ALL_LINKS_QUERY = gql`
  # 2
  query AllLinksQuery {
    allLinks {
      id
      createdAt
      url
      description
    }
  }
`

// use graphql container to combine component with the query
// also passing an option to the function call where you specify a name
// - this is the name of the prop apollo injects into the linklist component
// - if not specified, injected prop would be called 'data'
export default graphql(ALL_LINKS_QUERY, { name: 'allLinksQuery' }) (LinkList);
